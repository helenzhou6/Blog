## Definitions
* JavaScript -- compile/translator --> computer instructions (it parses/reads/interprets)

* **Syntax parsers** - A programme that reads code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid
* **Lexical environment** - where something sits physically in the code
* **Execution context** - Wrapper to help manage the code that is running
  * Lots of lexical environments but the running one is the execution context.

## Execution context
There are two phases to the execution context:

### Creation Phase
* The initial phase of setting up the execution context - **creation phase** - sets up the variables and functions in memory.
* The base execution context is the **global** one (meaning: not inside a function).

* After browser has run a JavaScript file, the **JavaScript engine** automatically creates these as part of the execution context:
  1. A **global object** (also contains all the variables and functions that are lexically global). The browser's global object is the `window`.
  2. Creates **`this`** - same as the `window` for browsers
  3. **Outer environment** in context to the code (at the global level this is `null`) - what the code is sitting on / reference to the outer lexical environment. Created by syntax parser.

* `undefined` = a value that means the variable has not been set. So declaring variables without values is `undefined` by default.

### Execution Phase
* **Execution phase** - runs your code line by line. Interprets, converts, compiles, and executes it.
* JS is **Single threaded** (one command executed at a time), **Synchronous execution** (one at a time and in order that it appears) in its behaviour
* JS will parse the code, compiler will create the Global execution context is created, then code is executed.

```js
function b() {

}
function a(){
  b();
}
a(); // is invoked the functions above 
```

* At `a()` / everytime function invoked - a new execution context is created within the **execution stack** (the one at the top is the one that is currently running). Within this context, will create and execute. 
  * So regardless of lexical positions, the code is run according to the order of the execution stack. Execution context is **popped** off the stack after the function has been fully run.

## Functions, context and variable environments
* **Variable environment** where the variables live and how they relate to each other in memory.
  * Each execution context has it's own variable environment. E.g.:
  ```js
  function b() {
    var myVar;
    console.log(myVar);
  }
  function a() {
    var myVar = 2; // different variable in memory
    console.log(myVar);
    b();
  }
  var myVar = 1;
  console.log(myVar);
  a();
  console.log(myVar);
  ```
  Where the `console` will show: `1, 2, undefined, 1`

* If remove `var myVar` from `b()` and just do `console.log(myVar)` instead, it is actually `1`. When request a variable - JavaScript look at current execution context, and then reference to its Outer environment. In the case of `b()` and `a()` - it is the `global` execution context. Because it `b()` and `a()` sits lexically on top of the `global` context. 
  * So the execution stack is important to see the order of what order functions are invoked / variables are created. When within the execution context, if it can't find the variable, it will look at the outer reference to look for variables there (the outer reference depends on where the function sits lexically). - Or another way of looking at it is, when was each variable/function created (during global stage?)
  * **Scope** - where a variable is available in your code. What was described above was the **scope chain** - links to the outer environment / where written

## Scope, ES6 & `let`
* `let` - allow JS engine to use **block scoping**.
  * During execution phase, can declare a variable, still in memory as `undefined`, but not allowed to use the variable until the code is run that declares the variable.
  * Variable is only available within the block at the time of running.

## Asynchronous callbacks
* **Asynchronous** more than one at a time
* The JS Engine - doesn't exist alone, there is the rendering engine (paints to screen the web page), HTTP request responses - there are hooks between these. Though these may all run asynchronously inside the browser, but just in the JS Engine, it is synchronous.
* The **event queue/loop** - notifications of events that might be happening. When the browser does something it is listening for, it is placed in the event queue.
  * JS engine only looks at the event queue when the execution stack is empty. Then will see if function is run based on the event - will then create execution context etc. How JS deals with async events.
